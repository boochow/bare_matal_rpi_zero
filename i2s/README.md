# I2S

I2S example for RPi Zero W.

This code generates I2S signal using RPi's PCM I/O hardware.

The signal is 8KHz sampled 16bit stereo.

Connect I2S device (DAC for example) to monitor the signal.

(WARNING! the sound is very LOUD. Please turn the volume down.)

BCLK: GPIO18, FS: GPIO19, DOUT: GPIO21
